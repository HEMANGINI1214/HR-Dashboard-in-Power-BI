📂 Steps Followed

🔹 Step 1: Importing Data into Power BI
Open Power BI and load the HR dataset (Excel/CSV format).
Check for missing values and data inconsistencies.
Use Power Query Editor for data cleaning and transformation.

🔹 Step 2: Data Cleaning & Transformation
Remove duplicates and handle missing values.
Convert data types (e.g., date formats, numeric values).
Create calculated columns for additional insights (e.g., Tenure, Age Grouping, Experience Level).
Add new measures using DAX (e.g., Total Employees, Attrition Rate, Average Salary).

🔹 Step 3: Building Relationships in Data Model
Define relationships between tables (e.g., linking Employee Details with Department Table).
Ensure one-to-many and many-to-one relationships are correctly set.

🔹 Step 4: Creating Visualizations
Use KPI Cards to display key metrics (Total Employees, Attrition Rate, Avg. Salary, etc.).
Bar Charts for department-wise employee distribution and salary comparison.
Pie Charts for gender distribution.
Line Charts for attrition trends over time.
Tree Map for hierarchical data like employee count per department.
Slicers for interactivity (e.g., filter by department, gender, experience level).

🔹 Step 5: Adding Interactivity & Filters
Use slicers and drill-through options for dynamic filtering.
Implement cross-filtering between visuals for better user experience.

🔹 Step 6: Formatting & Finalizing the Dashboard
Optimize layout for clarity and readability.
Use consistent colors and themes for a professional look.
Add titles, tooltips, and labels for better data interpretation.

🔹 Step 7: Publishing & Sharing
Publish the dashboard to Power BI Service.
Configure data refresh settings for real-time updates.
Share reports with stakeholders via Power BI online workspace.
